Me dan ganas de caminar para liberar el estrŽs que tengo en el d’a y solo salgo a la tienda a comprar cualquier.cosa para caminar unas cuadras por lo menos.
Hago ejercicio en casa pero no es lo mismo, extra–o el exterior.
Vivo sola, me gusta porque soy productiva en horarios laborales pero los viernes o fines de semana quisera tener con alguien de carne y hueso con quien platicar. No soy muy afecta a platicar por redes sociales, pero ahora se han vuelto importantes para tener contacto humano.
Me preocupa enfermarme o que mi familia se enferme. 
Me gusta leer articulos sobre la pandem’a para mantenerme informada pero mi tema favorito se ha vuelto la desigualdad que la pandemia evidenci—. Cuando todo esto acabe me gustar’a hacer algo, me niego a seguir disfrutando de ""privilegios"" como el acceso al agua potable mientras otros en mi pa’s no lo difrutan.
